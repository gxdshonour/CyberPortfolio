# CyberPortfolio

I am Godshonour Egba, a recent graduate with a BSc in Digital Forensics and Cyber Security. I am eager to enter the tech world as a Network Engineer or Security Analyst, and I have developed a strong foundation in network infrastruture, cybersecurity, and technical troubleshooting. Through my academic projects and hands-on experience, I have gained valuable skills that prepare me for industry-ready roles.

Additionally, I have earned my CompTIA Network+ certification, which has further proved and strengthened my expertise in networking fundamentals, firewall configurations, and troubleshooting. As part of my continuous learning, I am currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification to further my knowledge in network security and system administration.

During my journey, I also completed several cybersecurity virtual programs with leading companies such as Forage Mastercard and Google, gaining exposure to real-world security practices, SIEM tools, and incident detection and response.
