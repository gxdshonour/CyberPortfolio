# CyberPortfolio

I am [Godshonour Egba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/godshonour-egba-222411188/), a recent graduate with a BSc in Digital Forensics and Cyber Security. I am eager to enter the tech world as a Network Engineer or Security Analyst, and I have developed a strong foundation in network infrastructure, cybersecurity, and technical troubleshooting. Through my academic projects and hands-on experience, I have gained valuable skills that prepare me for industry-ready roles.

Additionally, I have earned my CompTIA Network+ certification, further proving and strengthening my expertise in networking fundamentals, firewall configurations, and troubleshooting. As part of my continuous learning, I am preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification to further my network security and system administration knowledge.

During my journey, I also completed several cybersecurity virtual programs with leading companies such as Forage Mastercard and Google. I gained exposure to real-world security practices, SIEM tools, and incident detection and response.
